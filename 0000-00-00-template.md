### Fist header (declares one of the larger steps in the tutorial)
When you need more headers, you are probably better of creating different articles, and link the articles under each header untill you reach the main part of your tutorial.
After the header, a brief description of what is build in the chapter is given. 

For this tutorial, we need an internal network with a router, edit the following URL to use in the tutorial
[Create an internal network]({{ '/articles/create-an-internal-network' | relative_url }})
